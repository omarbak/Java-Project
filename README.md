# Java-Project
Matching Cards project at KU Leuven (Object Oriented programming course).
 
# Notes: 
- The code needs lots of cleaning, it is mainly hard coded (will be fixed after I finish my degree).
- To run the code, run the mainmenu application, you'll have to choose everything on the main menu gui before the game starts.
- Might contain bugs (even though i tested it many times before presenting the code to the professor).
- I believe I got 10/12 on this project.
- Improvements : better leaderboard, single player vs ai bot, better GUI...
